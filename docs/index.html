    <h3> History of Arnis</h3>
    <p class="margin">
        Arnis, the national martial art of the Philippines, is a centuries-old tradition that reflects the Filipino people's ingenuity and resilience. Its origins trace back to pre-colonial times, when indigenous communities developed weapon-based combat systems for self-defense and tribal warfare. Techniques using sticks, knives, and bladed weapons, such as the Kris, laid the foundation for this versatile martial art.

            During the Spanish colonization, Arnis underwent a transformation influenced by fencing techniques introduced by the colonizers. The term "Arnis" is derived from the Old Spanish word "arn√©s," meaning armor. Although its practice was suppressed during Spanish and later American colonization, Filipino martial artists kept its traditions alive, ensuring its survival and revival in the 20th century.
            <br><br>
            Today, Arnis is celebrated as a symbol of Filipino heritage and identity, officially recognized as the national martial art and sport of the Philippines since 2009. Combining traditional methods with modern adaptations, Arnis continues to gain global recognition, showcasing the creativity and enduring spirit of the Filipino people. Its historical evolution highlights its significance as both a cultural treasure and a practical martial art. Let me know if you'd like further details!
